# Rick-and-Morty-viewing
Simple way to know about what is happening with the guys from Rick and Morty cartoon.

On the main screen you can see all characters with the current statuses each of them.

If you want to know a little more about any character - just click on the cell of character. Then you will be switched to another screen with details of this character.

The offline mode has been implemented in this App. It means that the App maintains maximum functionality without a network (or in the case of an unstable network). For this purpose I used Realm framework.
